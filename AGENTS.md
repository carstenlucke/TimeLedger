# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

All project documentation for agents — including build commands, architecture, IPC patterns, database migrations, build configuration, and localization — is maintained in **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**.

Please refer to `CLAUDE.md` as the single source of truth.
